# 🤖 AI-Powered Freelancer Recommendation System

This project is built as part of the **PeerHire AI/ML Internship Assignment**. It is a full-stack application that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to recommend the top 5 most relevant freelancers for a given job post, filtered by **budget** and **timeline**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a job description and client preferences (budget and timeline), recommend a ranked list of the top 5 freelancers best suited for the job based on:

- Skills and past projects
- Availability and expected hourly rate
- Semantic similarity with the job requirements

---

## 💡 Model Selection & Training Process

### 🔧 Data Used

- Dataset: `freelancer_profiles_updated.json` (100 synthetic freelancer profiles)
- Each freelancer has:
  - `skills`
  - `past_projects`
  - `experience_years`
  - `expected_rate`
  - `availability_in_days`
  - `rating`

### 🧠 Approach

1. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   Combined each freelancer's `skills` and `past_projects` into a single string for feature extraction.

2. **Vectorization with TF-IDF**:
   - Used `TfidfVectorizer` from **scikit-learn** to convert freelancer profiles and job descriptions into numeric vectors.
   - Trained only once and saved using `joblib` to avoid re-training on each API call.

3. **Filtering**:
   - Before scoring, freelancers are filtered based on:
     - `expected_rate <= job_budget`
     - `availability_in_days <= job_timeline`

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Used **Cosine Similarity** to measure semantic similarity between the job description and each freelancer's profile.
   - Top 5 freelancers with the highest similarity score are returned.
